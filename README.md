# Qtec Player - Flutter Video Player Appliction


Dive into an awesome video streaming experience with our Flutter Video Player App! We've built it with a clean structure and easy-to-use HooksRiverpod state management. The Home Page showcases trending videos with smooth scrolling and auto-loading for endless entertainment. Using the provided API (https://test-ximit.mahfil.net/api/trending-video/1?page=1), we fetch videos without hiccups. Clicking on a video thumbnail takes you to the Video Play Page, where playback starts when you hide the thumbnail. No extra API calls needed â€“ we get all the details from the video list page. Our smart state management, HooksRiverpod, keeps things organized and scalable. With a reliable video player library, we support HLS for smooth streaming. It's a simple, enjoyable app foundation, ready for future upgrades. Your ticket to hassle-free video fun! ðŸŽ‰

## Clean Architecture

In our Flutter Video Player App, we've organized things neatly using clean architecture, featuring different layers like the UI (presentation layer), the brainy part (domain layer), and the data manager (data layer). This setup brings perks like super easy changes, testing, and keeping everything in order. Each layer does its own thing without stepping on each other's toes. If we need to tweak or add new features, clean architecture makes it a breeze. Plus, it's like having a strong foundation â€“ we can grow the app without it getting messy. The clean architecture style we've chosen ensures our video player app stays in top shape, making it a smooth ride for maintenance and quick adjustments whenever needed. ðŸš€



## Riverpod State Mangement System

Its ease of use, flexible dependency management, and support for clean and testable code align well with the goals of creating a responsive and maintainable video streaming application.


## YoYo Video Player

Lecle YoYo Video Player is a HLS(.m3u8) video player for flutter (migrate from yoyo_player package). The lecle_yoyo_player is a video player that allows you to select HLS video streaming by selecting the quality. Lecle YoYo Player wraps video_player under the hood and provides base architecture for developers to create their own set of UI and functionalities.

The package has been updated with more customizable properties and fixed the report issues from the old package.
